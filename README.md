# Face Attractiveness Detection

This project provides a Python script to analyze the attractiveness of individuals in a group photo using the [Attractiveness Test API](https://attractivenesstest.com/) Android API. The script utilizes the YuNet model for face detection and performs image processing to evaluate and display attractiveness scores for each detected face.

## Features

- Detects faces in a group image.
- Rotates and aligns faces for better accuracy.
- Uploads individual face images to the Attractiveness Test API for analysis.
- Draws attractiveness scores directly on the original image.
- Proportional font size and thickness based on image resolution.
